- **Debouncing**: Search input optimization
- **Response Handling**: Standardized backend response processing

### Backend Integration
- Methods for user authentication (`register`, `login`)
- Profile management (`updateProfile`, `getDashboard`)
- Question handling (`getQuestions`, `getNextQuestion`, `submitAnswer`, `addCustomQuestion`)
- System operations (`deploySystem`, `getDeployedSystems`)
- Chat functionality (`chatWithSystem`)

## Component Architecture

### Main Application Structure
- **App.jsx**: Root component with routing and state management
- **AuthModal**: Handles user authentication flows
- **DashboardTab**: Displays user stats and profile
- **TrainingTab**: Manages question answering system
- **SystemsTab**: Implements digital consciousness network
- **SettingsTab**: Provides profile configuration

### UI Patterns
- **Card-based Layout**: Consistent content containers
- **Floating Labels**: Enhanced form inputs
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations
- **Empty States**: Helpful placeholders for empty data
- **Toast Messages**: Temporary status notifications
